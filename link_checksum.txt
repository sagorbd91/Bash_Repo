# hard link and soft link
===========================

each and every file has a inode. In hardlink original file and hard link will be point to same inode. so if you delete the original
file hard link will not be deleted. But there is a problem in hardlink which is you need to be in same file system. For example you
have C drive and D drive file you can not link that. 


In softlink you are linking with original file. if the original file removed your soft link will not work. In softlink 
original file will get an Inode and softlink will get an Inode.

# ls -li [it will give you the inode information of the file]

# cd accessright [now we create a hardlink of previous folder file in the current file]
# ln ../bash.txt bash_hardlink
After putting the command of hardlink you can see inode number is same and the type will be 2 of the file in current directory.



# ln -s ../bash.txt bash_softlink.txt[this is the softlink]
# ls -li


Checksum
========

# cksum <file name>
# md5sum <file name>

# md5sum permission.txt sample.txt > hash.txt

[Check everything is fine or not]
